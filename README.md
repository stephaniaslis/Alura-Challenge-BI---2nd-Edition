## :link: Dataset
The dataset is a dump of sql files, avaiable on this link 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/106j-3sbhHp5CiWNxQWZDydKKoRgPc70z

The first step is create a database with the following code

CREATE DATABASE iii_semana

After that use MySQL and restoring a database:

![restore dump](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82055743/157261712-4dc693e1-b2a6-4b96-bd34-11e999936806.png)

Finally the database will be on schemas:

![create database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82055743/157262273-2caaa13d-7d16-424d-bfe4-7dc78deffa53.png)

The last step is load the database on PowerBI.

## :broom: Data cleaning
- Removal of id produto (product id) number 239 because there isn't values of preÃ§o (price), custo (cost) and categoria (category), probably it is a mistake.

## :bar_chart: Data analysis and Dashboard
There was some columns that had to be imported to make some measures:

The price product is imported from the 'iii_semana produtos'[PREÃ‡O] to 'iii_semana produtos'[Price product] using the following formula:


Price product = LOOKUPVALUE( 'iii_semana produtos'[PREÃ‡O], 'iii_semana produtos'[ID Produto],  'iii_semana itens_pedido'[ID Produto])

Other columns were created in iii_semana itens_pedido table :


Partial revenue = 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Price product] * 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Quantidade_Vendida]


Cost product = LOOKUPVALUE('iii_semana produtos'[CUSTO DO PRODUTO],'iii_semana produtos'[ID Produto], 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[ID Produto])


Partial cost = 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Cost product] * 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Quantidade_Vendida]


Partial profit = 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Partial revenue] -'iii_semana itens_pedido'[Partial cost] 


Category name = LOOKUPVALUE('iii_semana produtos'[Category name],'iii_semana produtos'[ID Produto], 'iii_semana itens_pedido'[ID Produto])

There was created measureas the following metrics:
- Average Ticket Price
- Amount of sales
- Revenue
- Cost 
- Profit

And charts to:
- Revenue by category
- Revenue by sales person
-Partial profit, revenue and cost by trimester


The dashboard is avaiable on the following link:

And the mobile version were creates as well:
